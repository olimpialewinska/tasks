## Tasks

Welcome to the To Do List project!

This is a web application built using Laravel, a popular PHP framework, and Bootstrap for the front-end design. We also used jQuery to enhance the user experience.

In this project, you can create a list of tasks and assign them to different people. You can also add people to the list and send tasks to them. The database used for this project is MySQL.

To get started, make sure you have Laravel and MySQL installed on your machine. Then, clone the repository and run the necessary migrations to set up the database. Finally, start the development server and you'll be ready to go.

We hope you enjoy using the To Do List project and find it helpful in keeping track of your tasks and assignments. Thank you for checking it out!
